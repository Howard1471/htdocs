My name is Howard Keene.  At the time of writing I am 52 years old (just). I have a background in IT which stretches back 30 years and I have performed most of the roles within it. I’ve chosen to go back to University, as a Mature Student, to do something I wish I’d done years ago. I’m studying for a degree in Software Engineering.

I am the proud father of three, one son and two daughters. The eldest, Michael, is 21.  Frances is 19 and Victoria, my youngest, is 17 and studying for her A levels. They are all very proud of their Dad and his choice to go back to university, they are following my progress with great interest.

I started out as an electronics engineer with a company manufacturing control and information electronics. Being a small company I would be involved in every aspect of the day-to-day hands-on work required by the business. From building the control units, troubleshooting and repairing them to the on site installation of the same equipment.

Since then I have worked with a wide range of equipment including Automatic Teller Machines in banks, EPoS equipment and computer systems in shops and offices, across the UK.  I’ve managed teams of engineers and other technical staff and I’ve worked closely with end users, such as jobcentre and bank staff.  I’ve managed projects to role out new hardware to offices and administered progress reports.

Along the way I’ve taught myself some programming skills.  I’ve used these skills to help me perform my roles and I’ve learnt a lot about the systems that I’ve been working with at the same time.  This is where my interests lie.

I’m looking to my time at NTU to provide me with further knowledge and skills to enable me to progress and continue programming and learning.  I am expecting a lot of hard work along the way but feel that the end results will be worthwhile.
