		<h1>General Information</h1>
		<p>The Nursery</p>
		<p>The Manor House Nursery is set out on two levels, decorated and 
		furnished with children in mind. We offer a high standard of care for 
		children aged from 3 months to 8 years. The top floor caters for ages 2 
		to 8 years, with the lower floor being for 3 months to 2 year olds. Our 
		aim is to provide a warm, friendly and relaxed learning environment 
		which feels like a home from home for your child.<br>
		<br>
		Planning</p>
		<p>From September 2008, The Manor House Nursery has been setting the 
		standards for learning, development and care, using the 
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.standards.dfes.gov.uk/eyfs/">Early Years 
		Foundation Stage</a> framework. Every child deserves the best start in life 
		to fulfil their potential. A Childs experience in the early years has a 
		major impact on their future Chances. The EYFS is the framework that 
		provides that assurance.<br>
		<br>
		The over arching of the EYFS is to help children achieve the five Every 
		Child Matters outcomes of staying safe, being healthy, enjoying and 
		achieving, making a positive contribution, and achieving economic well 
		being. This is done by: Setting the standards for learning and 
		development and ensuring every child makes progress and no child is left 
		behind. Providing for equality of opportunity and anti discriminatory 
		practice, ensuring every child is included and not disadvantaged by 
		ethnicity, culture or religion, home language, family background, 
		learning disabilities or gender. Creating the framework for partnership 
		working with parents and professionals, and between all the settings the 
		child attends. Improving quality and consistency in the early year's 
		sector. Laying a secure foundation for future learning through planned 
		learning and development based around individual needs and interest s of 
		the child, and informed by the use of ongoing observational assessments.<br>
		<br>
		Registration &amp; Safety<br>
		<br>
		The Manor House Nursery is registered with 
		<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ofsted.gov.uk/">O.F.S.T.E.D</a> (Office For 
		Standards in Education), under the terms of The Children Act 2006, to 
		provide full day care for babies and children from 3 months to 8 years.

		<br>
		We have a number of written policies on key areas of security, health 
		and safety, which are available for parents to look at on request.<br>
		<br>
		For the safety of children we ensure that:<br>
		
		• There is an appropriate ratio of staff to children.<br>
		
		• A staff knows personally who will be collecting each child.<br>
		
		• Their equipment and rooms are safe, clean and secure. We also ensure 
		that all staff.<br>
		
		• Have training in First Aid and Health and Safety aspects of Nursery 
		care.<br>
		
		• Are aware of, and carry out all policies and procedures.<br>
		
		• Take part in regular fire practices.<br>
		
		The Nursery building and its surroundings are 'smoke free' areas. Staff, 
		volunteers, parents and visitors are not permitted to smoke within the 
		Nursery grounds. We believe that all children and staff within our 
		environment have the right to breathe 'clean air'.<br>
		We are confident that our excellent procedures ensure that we maintain 
		the highest possible standards in the way we care for the health, safety 
		and well being of babies and children.<br>
		<br>
		Staff<br>
		<br>
		At The Manor House Nursery we believe that our staff are our greatest 
		asset. We employ only qualified and experienced staff who genuinely 
		enjoy working with babies and Pre School children. All of our Senior 
		Nursery Nurses and Nursery Nurses hold NNEB, or equivalent 
		qualifications, and demonstrate an ability to approach their work with 
		maturity and sensitivity. The Manor House Nursery then consolidates that 
		training and experience further by providing ongoing internal and 
		external training developing skills, abilities and knowledge. We are 
		confident that this approach will be responsible for a low turnover of 
		staff at this Nursery, which in turn provides an atmosphere of stability 
		and security for babies and children, enabling quality of care to remain 
		at a consistently high standard. In addition, we facilitate a limited 
		number of placements for students undertaking childcare and other 
		related courses. Students on placement with us are selected by us, and 
		work under the close supervision of trained and experienced staff. We 
		believe that by employing hlghly motivated, committed, quality staff, we 
		provide a first class Pre school experience that parents can have 
		confidence in, and children positively enjoy and thrive upon.<br>
		<br>
		Illness<br>
		<br>
		Parents are requested not to send their child to Nursery if they are 
		suffering from any infectious diseases or if they are not feeling well 
		enough to attend. Although the nursery has a realistic attitude to the 
		needs of working parents, it reserves the right to contact parents if 
		their child becomes ill during nursery hours.<br>
		Parents are requested to notify the nursery if their child contracts or 
		has been in contact with any normal childhood infectious diseases. The 
		nursery reserves the right to refuse entry to any child who they 
		consider to be unwell.<br>
		The nursery will only administer prescribed medicine if parents have 
		written and signed the nursery medication record on arrival.<br>
		<br>
		Change of address<br>
		<br>
		Parents are asked to inform the nursery of any change of address or 
		telephone number at home or at work immediately.<br>
		<br>
		Excursions<br>
		<br>
		The nursery will not take any child out of the nursery grounds without 
		the written permission of the parents.<br>
		<br>
		Loss and damages<br>
		<br>
		The nursery cannot be responsible for loss or damage to property or 
		clothing. All outdoor clothing including shoes, Jumpers, cardigans and 
		bags must be labelled.<br>
		<br>
		Security<br>
		<br>
		Under no circumstances will child be allowed to leave the nursery anyone 
		unknown to the nursery staff, unless previously arranged by the parent 
		or guardian with a senior member of staff. A photo of your child, or a 
		password arranged by you will be needed for authorised collection.<br>
		<br>
		If parents make prior arrangement by telephone for their child to be 
		collected by somebody unknown to nursery staff, the nursery will require 
		the name, address and telephone number of the chosen guardian, and they 
		will require proof of identity on their arrival.<br>
		<br>
		All children should be collected promptly at their finishing time.<br>
		<br>
		Our insurance policy allows us to care for children between the hours of 
		7.30am. and 6.30pm ONLY, and therefore children should not be in the 
		nursery building outside of these hours. If parents fail to collect 
		their child by 6.00pm, a £20.00 flat fee will be added onto invoices for 
		every time parents are late.<br>
		<br>
		The 'Safe Guarding' of Children<br>
		<br>
		Every member of our staff team, from Management to students have to go 
		through the process of being CRB checked before working in Nursery. This 
		is to ensure the safe guarding of children by allowing any Child 
		Protection issues or Criminal Records to be shown on the check. Anybody 
		who is found to be unsuitable to work with children will not be employed 
		by The Manor House Nursery. The welfare and protection of children is 
		paramount, and as new legislation rightly suggests, the 'Safe Guarding' 
		of any child is a number one priority. All of our staff have some form 
		of Child Protection training, and recognise that everyone has a 
		responsibility to ensure that a child is safe whether it is inside or 
		out of the Nursery environment.<br>
		<br>
		As well as staff being appropriately trained, there may be times when 
		practitioners have to talk to each other to share relevant information. 
		The governments Every Child Matters programme states that staff should 
		work together and identify support needs at the earliest stage possible. 
		There may be times when it is necessary to share information without 
		consent if it is felt to be to your Childs best interest and if your 
		Childs needs cannot be met in any other way. Information may be shared 
		with social workers, the safeguarding teams or other relevant caring 
		professionals. For more information on 'Safe Guarding' or Protecting 
		children, our Child Protection Officer in Nursery will be happy to speak 
		to you.<br>
		<br>
		Attendance<br>
		<br>
		If children are ill or do not attend Nursery, parents will be charged 
		for the booked sessions. All children under 3 years of age, or who DO 
		NOT claim Nursery Grant, are entitled to two free weeks per year, which 
		can be used as holidays or sickness. After these two weeks, parents will 
		be charged the full amount for all hours booked. These two weeks will 
		run from your Childs start date up until the following year after, and 
		all weeks not used by the end of this time will be lost.<br>
		<br>
		Nursery Grant entitlement is for children aged three to five years, and 
		children become eligible for the funding, from the beginning of the term 
		following their third Birthday. Nursery Grant hours are available for 38 
		weeks of the year, during term time only, and are available in sessions 
		where you are able to 'top up' your hours if you wish to do so. For more 
		information on Nursery Grant entitlement, please do not hesitate to 
		contact a member of The Manor House Management Team.<br>
		<br>
		Children, who claim Nursery Grant entitlement, are required to take all 
		holidays during the Non Grant weeks. If parents decide to take holidays 
		when Nursery Grant is being claimed, or your child does not attend when 
		they should, you will be charged for their 'top up' hours and breaks 
		during full day sessions.<br>
