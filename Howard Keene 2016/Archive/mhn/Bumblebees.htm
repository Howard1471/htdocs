<h2>Pre School - 3 to 5 Years Old</h2><br>

<p>

Welcome to the Bumble Bee room. 
<br>
This room cares for children aged between 3 and 5 years old. This room is bright and spacious providing an ideal environment for your child to learn through play.
<br>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>

The daily routine is a more structured one in order to meet all the early learning goals set out in the Early Years Foundation Stage.
Planned activities are based on existing knowledge and skills and built upon to the next stage providing a challenge to maintain interest and enthusiasm. 
</p>
<p>

Equipment and activities reflect this change of developing abilities.
Topics/themes are planned with a Childs interest in mind and will last 3 to 4 weeks depending on sustained interest.
</p>
<p>

As your child is in preparation for school we will concentrate on encouraging independence e.g. toileting, dressing, 
table manners etc. Children will be working in groups so promoting social skills and positive behaviour patterns.
Older children will have opportunities to concentrate on writing, number and IT skills 
in small closely supervised groups. 
Work will be adapted to challenge or simplified to meet the needs of each child.
Curiosity and boundless energy are the hallmarks of this stage of development.</p>
<p>

&nbsp;<br>It is time to explore numbers and letter play with an extensive range of imaginative games. 
Your child will access activities that link and consolidate all areas of learning maths, language, 
creative, and science and social skills. This knowledge and skill will facilitate the foundation steps to the next stage into formal learning.
<br>Their planned routines will include going out to play in the garden to enjoy the fresh air and have fun using the outdoor equipment.
