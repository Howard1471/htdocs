Christmas comes but once a year and when it does it\'s full of cheer.
This year has been no different with Christmas coming, as expected, in December. There never seems to be shortage of Christmas days. We use one every year but we never seem to run out of them.  Perhaps there\'s a factory in the valleys somewhere turning out Christmas days. The collective noun for them is simply a \"Christmas\" of days. Many-a-time I have been stopped by aquaintances and asked have you had a good \"Christmas\".  The simple answer to this question is \"Yes\".  To respond with \"No\" is inviting the unwanted \"Oh dear, why was that?\" question and the conversation will drag on into unspecified topics.

The Christmas season is also full of beer. Funny how it rhymes with \"cheer\" and not with \"drunk\" or \"uncontrollable\".  These two latter descriptions are usually kept for the morning after the office party when one person or another will be described using them.
Only the boss will escape public humiliation.  Bosses are huniliated in private whispered conversations between staff. The rest of us get it out aloud.
