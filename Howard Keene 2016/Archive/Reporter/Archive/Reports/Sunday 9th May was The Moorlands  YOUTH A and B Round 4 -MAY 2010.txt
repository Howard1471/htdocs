Sunday 9th May was The Moorlands Challenge Lusky YOUTH A and B Championship Trial  hosted by Cheadle (Staffs) Auto Club.

With a good entry everything pointed to it being a good trial. Consisting of three laps of 10 sections that were slightly easy this meant  marks taken were going to be very low and every ?dab? was going to count and could not be made back. Time was cut to Four and a half hours due to less sections a lap as a result of lack of available observers on the day.

Representing ACE in the YOUTH A class was Tom Dexter.  With Toms ?minder? this year Chris away competing in the SSDT minding it was down to  ?good old dad?!  

Although Chris was absent Tom rode ?solid? all day resulting in a ?one dab? score right up until the end of Lap One where he had a unlucky five. 

Again on the second lap he was on four until the bike stalled in his Nemesis section right at the end. 

Lap Three was completed for a two dabs. Tom finished his day overall in fourth place and just of the Youth A podium . 

Representing the team in the YOUTH B class was Bradley Cox from Oxford. Working with his new minder Marcus Shirley (Ross Danby?s world minder for years) Brad was confident from the start and had his only ?dab? on section three on the last lap.  

Finishing the day on just ?one mark lost? Brad secured second place on the podium in a very closely contested Youth B 2010 Championship.

Tom and Brad would like to thank the ACE team sponsors listed below for their continued support to them and their team mates Joanne Coles and Nikita Smith.
