With Team trucks having been asked to arrive at the padock at Hawkstome between 1pm and 2.30pm the Ace Team Truck arrived at 2.20pm and set up in the Teams paddock next to the Spanish federation wagon RFME.

With Top Trials team of Italy and the Italia federation Truck flying to Round 8 and working out of the trucks of Sherco and Beta as they had decided that Great Britain was too far to drive, there was only Ace Trials Team - The British trials team on the World circuit, and the RFME trucks in the teams paddock.

The British World round started at 4pm on Friday for Ace Trials team with this being the time allocated for official practice.

Being as it was the British Round Friday, Saturdays and Sundays timetable was extremely full for Ace Trials Team as they are the British World Trials Team and the teams sponsors had been invited to attend. 

Saturday starting with, at 9.30 am for the public a Public Test Session. 

This was a chance for members of the general public to try out and inspect all the various manufactureres models in the paddock. A fantastic idea and was extremely popular on the day. However, no-one was allowed into the Sherco camp at this time as the launch of the 2008 model was being done at 2.30pm later that day and it was all very carefully guarded until then.

However, for Ace riders Lee Sampson and Richard Ellwood 9.30am meant signing on followed by scrutineering at 10.am. 10.30 am was allocated for official autographs, and so for members of the public who were \"switch on\" to all the various attractions available on the day this was a fantastic opportunity for them to get their top riders signatures.

11am was the second chance to get in some official practice for all the World contenders.

Returning at 1pm after practice session, Lee and Richard went inside the Ace Trials Team truck to discuss tactics, expectations and positions with Team Manager Mark and Team Minder Chris.

For the general public 1pm till 2.30 pm was the Mini Masters trial, a great opportunity to watch all the old masters in the central Arena in Hawkstone.

Ace Team chief bottle washer, Michele had invitied her father and his life long trials buddies Dave leggett and Alan Ketley to join the team in the paddock for the entire Britrish World Round. (all are sponsors of the team) and for anyone who has been around the South Eastern Centre for the past 4 decades, these names will be instantly recognisable. Bob Adams riding name for the past 4 decades has been \"ace\" !!!

2.30 was section inspection time for the riders but it was also the time for the 2008 Sherco unveiling. Lee, Richard and Chris went to inspect sections at 2.30pm as per the official timetable for the day and under the instructions of Mark, leaving Team Manager Mark and daughters Amy and Emma along with Daughter in law in waiting Mel to go to the Sherco launch. See our web site for photos of the team at this launch.

Lee and Richard returned at 6pm, with Chris and Mark ( who had joined them later after the launch party ) to discuss in the team truck , the best lines and changes that needed to be made if the rain that was forecast overnight arrived

Trials central had organised a tent to allow everyone to socialise during Friday and Saturday nights so Saturday night was spent
doing exactly this but with a 10.15 curfew for the whole team always the night before a race night, the day ended at 10.30 in the truck with lights out and the whole team looking forward to Sundays World Round.

Sunday arrived with the overnight rain that was forecast having arrived.
As 9 am arrived however the sun had come out and remained out for the rest of the day. 

Richards start time was 10.04 just 2 minutes before Lee\'s start time of 10.06. This meant that the whole team would be able to travel the course together.

Positions had been discussed the previous day during team discussions and it was agreed that Richard would be finishing with a top Ten position and Lee on Podium if possible.

Richard had a fantastic start to the days ride cleaning every section he came to until section 5. Lee commented to Mark at section 4 - \"Richards on it today\". However, Richard had broken his Sherco frame in the previous round and this was not replaced in time as it had been left of the factory lorry, therefore Richard was not riding his Race bike but his spare. With no slack dabs all day, only cleans and maximums Richard delivered for the team and finished the day in the TOP TEN and with his first TOP TEN position of the year and points to add to the last 2 rounds scores. (Remember folks that Richard finished last year and started this year with Ace finishing around 21st in all World Rounds! - we told you he was on his way to the top and by *** he is)

Richard said at the end of the trial \" I am pleased with my ride today however, I am disappointed that all the failures I got were right at the ends cards and I am not pleased with my rides on section 14 both laps. That was slack.. I should have held on till the end but a top ten is what I was aiming for today and I have done that. It was really nice to have my parents here today too as they have not been able to watch me in the other rounds this year. I am aiming for a top 9 in Andorra now\"

It had been arranged, without Lee knowing, for his sisters and their family to come and watch Lee in the BRITISH World Round and for section passes for the day to be available, but jake and Martin giving them all area passes instead. 

Lee started the day off with a few mistakes up until he got to section 8 when he noticed his sisters in the crowd.!!! From then on Lee was \"on Fire\" but unfortunately the damage had been done already and a podium place was not going to be his this round.

A world round is not the ideal place to watch your little brother ride for the first time but after Lees sisters Abbey and Sarah realised that he was in no real danger with his minder Mark close to hand, they relaxed and enjoyed watching Lee perform his magic for them for the rest of the trial.

Lee said at the end of the trial \" I could not beleive it when I saw my sisters in the crowd, it was awesome. I would like to thank everyone who made this possible and I am sorry I did not get on podium for you all\".



Finally, Ace Trials team would like to congratulate Michael Brown for becoming Junior World Trials champion 2007 as well as thanking Andrea Holmes and all at L and M events limited and everyone else involved with the British World round for making it such a fantastic success.
