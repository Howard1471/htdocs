<p class="content">When any child goes anywhere to be looked after for the very first time, it is the most daunting and frightening experience any parent goes through.
Will they be ok? Will they be looked after? will they be fed properly? will they settle?
My two children are at The Manor House and I went through all of these things, but never have I felt that this childcare is the wrong place, setting or facility for them.  The care that they receive is second to none and more importantly when you don't even get a 'goodbye' in the morning from your children... what more can you ask for!
A caring, friendly, happy environment that my children have benefitted from being part of.
