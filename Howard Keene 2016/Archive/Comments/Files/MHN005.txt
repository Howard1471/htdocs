Ieuan has only been going to The Manor house for three weeks and I was very concerned about sending him to a nursery.  We chose The Manor House because of the late closing time and the lovely big outdoor play area.<br />
To my relief Ieuan has already settled in and enjoys going to nursery.  We have found the staff very friendly and they have been fantastic at helping to get Ieuan to eat.<br />
Each day Ieuan receives a report of his activities, what he has eaten and when he has slept.  We find this really useful.<br />
Everyone at The Manor House look after Ieuan wonderfully and I am Happy to leave him in this safe environment.
