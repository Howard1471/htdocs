The Manor House Nursery has provided all three of my children with excellent quality care and a happy learning environment.  Throughout each stage of their development as they have progress through the nursery, the children have been looked after by staff who are caring, thoughtful and knowledgeable about all the children in their care.  My children have certainly looked forward to attending nursery and even now two of them attend Primary School outside of the Eckington area, they are still keen to go back and see the staff who have previously played such an important role in their lives!<br />

I have been particularly impressed with the transition to Primary School from the pre-school "Bumblebee Room".  The activities which the children have taken part in have thoroughly prepared them for their "Reception" year at school and on both occasions, their Primary School teachers have also commented positively on the good grounding they have received at nursery.<br />

Choosing a nursery to care for small children is a difficult decision, but I feel that the Manor House Nursery has provided an excellent standard of care, and are constantly striving to improve the service and opportunities which they provide for the children to learn from.<br />
