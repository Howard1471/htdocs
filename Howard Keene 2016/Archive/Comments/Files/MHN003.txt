When any child goes anywhere to be looked after for the very first time, it is the most daunting and frightening experience any parent goes through.<br>
Will they be ok? Will they be looked after? will they be fed properly? will they settle?<br>
My two children are at The Manor House and I went through all of these things, but never have I felt that this childcare is the wrong place, setting or facility for them.  The care that they receive is second to none and more importantly when you don't even get a 'goodbye' in the morning from your children... what more can you ask for!<br>
A caring, friendly, happy environment that my children have benefitted from being part of<br>
