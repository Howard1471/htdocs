		<p>I have 2 children of my own, aged 18Yrs and 6Yrs.&nbsp; I have been 
		childminding now for 3 years and enjoy doing the job.&nbsp; No two days 
		are the same and all the children I care for are great fun to care for.</p>
		<p>We have two pets, a cat and a rabbit who lives inside.</p>
		<p>Before I started childminding I worked in Catering.</p>
		<p>We have an enclosed garden to the rear of the house with lots of toys 
		to play with, swings, slide, sandpit and water play tray.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>
		<p>Inside I have a playroom where the children can choose what they want 
		to play with, including a Sony Playstation and football table, colour TV 
		and books, puzzles and games.</p>
