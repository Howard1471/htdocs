        <h3>History of the club</h3>
        <p>The club was founded in 1990 by students and instructors on a RAE course being run at the 
        Fairham Community College in Clifton Notts. Over the years it has met at a pub and various 
        community centres. The club shack at the Fairham College was demolished in 2003 and the club 
        moved to Green’s Mill in Nottingham. In 2018 the club relocated to Mapperley Plains Social 
            Club [North East Nottingham] where it enjoys all the club facilities and a bigger room to meet in.</p>

        <p>Our club uses the callsign G8DD (held by David Hill M0BWY).</p>
