        <h1>Welcome to South Notts ARC</h1>
        <p> Welcome to the South Notts Amateur Radio Club Web Site. We are a vibrant and fun club aiming to further the interest 
        of its members in all aspects of amateur radio and associated activities. The club operates HF and VHF stations on special 
        event weekends and on club nights. 
        We also run construction projects, lectures and discussion evenings. Training at foundation, intermediate and full license 
        levels is available to club members. Please feel free to visit on club nights where a warm welcome awaits you.</p>

        <h2>Where we are</h2>
        <p>In May 2018 South Notts ARC moved to their current clubrooms, from their long time home at Green’s Mill in Sneinton, 
        to Mapperly Plains Social Club at Plains Rd, Nottingham NG3 5RH.

        If you’d like to join us in our new location please get in touch with us via the contact page, for more information.</p>
